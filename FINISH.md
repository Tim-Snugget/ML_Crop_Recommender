# The result of what I did

I installed streamlit and sklearn using ```pip install``` with Python3.8

Then, I ran the application using ```streamlit run app.py```.

At last, I tried to make a prediction by changing variables, but there was an error that I couldn't seem to understand and fix...

I was able to run the webapp, but couldn't fix the error and test things with different models.
